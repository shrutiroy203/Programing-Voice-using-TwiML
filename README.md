# Using Twilio to Replace Key Fob Entry in my apartment

Once during a christmas break, I was anticipating a friend to come over and borrow my car. She had to go on a hike early morning at 6a.m. the next day. I asked her to call me and I will buzz her in and she could pick up the car from the garage.

The next morning came and went, and I woke up at 10am to lot of angry missed calls and text messages. 

Such issues could arise often - that is when i decided to work on automating the response to the apartment phone entry system. The call will go to a number (which I bought) and automatically buzz people in with secret passcode (which I provided in advance!)

For this I needed two things:

1. Twillio Account: To automate the call response
2. AWS Account: To host my php server
